# JetBrains Material Theme 
This is a [Material Theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme) port of both the UI and UX for JetBrains products.

**Please note:** This is a work in progress. There are some work to be done before this can be considered stable.

## Supported IDEs

Thanks to the awesome guys at [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) the plugin is now supported on pretty much all IDEs from the same company. There are still some work to do to get it perfect on all IDEs, but we're close.

* Any JetBrains IDE (I haven't tested all of them, but I'm pretty certain it should work on the majority)
 - PyCharm (4.5)
* Android Studio is partly supported

_EAP releases only partly supported_

## Installation
* Download [Material Theme.zip](https://github.com/ChrisRM/material-theme-jetbrains/raw/master/Material%20Theme.zip)    
* Open `Preferences` -> `Plugins` -> `Install plugin from disk...` and choose the zip.
* Go to `Preferences` -> `Editor` -> `Colors & Fonts` -> `Scheme` -> Choose between the 3 Material Theme's.

**NOTE**: This plugin will no longer set the active color scheme for you. Make sure you follow step 3 above to set it manually. This is to avoid overriding your own custom schemes.

## TODO
* Improve colour schemes.
* Improve UI.
* Add more icons.
* Dynamically change the UI colors according to the active color scheme.
* Add support for EAP releases.

## Contribution

I would love to get some help on the colour schemes. Send me a pull request!
